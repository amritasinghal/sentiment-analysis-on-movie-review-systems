This project finds out if a movie review is positive or negative by using data science and machine learning. First, the reviews are cleaned by removing extra words and symbols.  After that, a machine learning model is trained to learn from the reviews. For example, if someone writes “The movie was really good and I loved the acting”, the system will predict it as Positive. If the review is “The movie was boring and too long”, it will predict Negative. This project can help in understanding what people think about movies and can be improved in the future by using advanced models and even making a web app.
